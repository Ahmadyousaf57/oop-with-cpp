This repository contains Object Oriented Programming concepts and programs that I studied and implemented during my **2nd semester** of my Computer Science degree.



# Topics Covered

- Classes and Objects
- Encapsulation
- Abstraction
- Inheritance
- Polymorphism

# Advanced Concepts
- Constructors and Destructors
- Function Overloading
- Operator Overloading
- File Handling

# Other Topics
- Exception Handling
- Pointers with Objects



# Technologies Used
- Programming Language: **C++**
- IDE: Code::Blocks / Visual Studio Code



# Learning Outcomes
- Understanding object-oriented design
- Writing reusable and maintainable code
- Applying OOP concepts to real-world problems
- Improving program structure and scalability



# Note
These programs were created for **learning and academic purposes** during the 2nd semester.  
Focus is on understanding concepts rather than advanced optimization.
